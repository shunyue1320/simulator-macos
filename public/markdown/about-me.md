# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ now an intern at CETC and a research assistant at Peking University. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2020. I'm now waiting for starting my graduate study.

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

Research-wise, I'm currently mainly working on topics related to exploring the capability of machines to develop intelligent behavior upon what they have learned, like meta-learning and continual learning.

I used to work on natural language processing (machine translation and language generation), image captioning and image aesthetic assessment.

I'm also learning to build machine learning softwares and systems. I'm also learning TypeScript, React, Electron and Golang.
